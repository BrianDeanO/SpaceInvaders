# We first define a few make macros (symbolic constants) with "=".
# Like macros in general, make macros help us maintain "D-R-Y" (Don't
# Repeat Yourself) and make the makefile more readable.

# Fill in the {}'s with the approriate file names. These should be the
# only changes you need to make to the makefile.

# These are the executables (aka "binfiles" or "bins").

# "-g" says to compile in support for the debugger (gdb). The "-W"
# warnings are the bare minimum I recommend. There are lots of others:

# Having defined macros, we start on the actual targets.

# ".PHONY" declares a target that is not a real file. The first target
# is the default target produced by entering "make" alone on the
# command line, hence the name "default". Apart from this, I generally
# put targets in alphabetical order for readability.

# For each object file, create a rule like this that says (a) what it
# depends on (to the right of ":") and (b) how to compile the source
# file into the object file. "$<" means "the first file (here the
# source file) to the right of the ':'" above.

# This says how to link one or more "*.o" files into a bin. "$^" means

# compiling and loading.

# You will need one rule like this for each bin.

# what you submit in your tarball.
